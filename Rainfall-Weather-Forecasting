Rain Prediction â€“Weather forecasting

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.

Rain Dataset is to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow. The Dataset contains about 10 years of dail1. Problem Statement: 
a) Design a predictive model with the use of machine learning algorithms to forecast whether or not it will rain tomorrow.

b)  Design a predictive model with the use of machine learning algorithms to predict how much rainfall could be there.
